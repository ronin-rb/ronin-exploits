  exploits {Ronin::Exploits::Exploit#test test} method to determine if the
  target is vulnerable or not.
* Added the `ronin-exploits completion` command to install shell completion
  files for all `ronin-exploits` commands for Bash and Zsh shells.

### 1.0.5 / 2024-06-19

#### CLI

* Correctly assign the `-d` short flag to `--debug` and the `-D` short flag to
  `--dry-run` for the `ronin-exploits run` command.
* Multiple bug fixes to the `ronin-exploits new` command:
  * Create the parent directory of the new exploit file, if it already doesn't
    exist, when running `ronin-exploits new path/to/new_exploit.rb`.
  * Fixed a bug where `ronin-exploits new -t open_redirect` was not being
    accepted as a valid exploit type.
  * Fixed a bug in `ronin-explotis new` where `-t xss` and `-t ssti` were not
    adding placeholder `base_path` and `query_param` metadata attributes to the
    newly generated exploit file.
  * Fixed a typo in the example `escape_expr` metadata attribute added by
    `ronin-exploits new -t ssti`.

  `--author-email`, or `--summary` were not properly escaping given values.

### 1.0.2 / 2023-06-12

  `ronin-exploits` will never contain any built-in exploits.
* Avoid using `case`/`in` syntax for TruffleRuby.
* Documentation fixes and improvements.
