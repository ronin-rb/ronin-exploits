  module Exploits
    #
    # The {Exploit} class allows for describing exploits for security
    # vulnerabilities, purely in Ruby. Exploits contain metadata about the
    # exploit/vulnerability and methods which defines the functionality
    # of the exploit. Exploits may also include additional
    # {Mixins mixin modules} to add additional functionality, such as defining
    # targets or loading in a payload.
    #
    # ## Philosophy
    #
    # Exploits are just programs with steps to build and launch the exploit.
    # Exploits also typically contain metadata that describes the exploit's
    # author(s), release date, what the exploit does, etc.
    #
    # The {Exploit} class defines six key parts:
    #
    # 1. Metadata - defines information about the exploit.
    # 2. Params - user configurable parameters.
    # 3. {Exploit#test test} - optional method that tests whether the target is
    #    vulnerable or not.
    # 4. {Exploit#build build} - method which builds the exploit.
    # 5. {Exploit#launch launch} - method which launches the exploit.
    # 6. {Exploit#cleanup cleanup} - optional Method which performs additional
    #    cleanup steps.
    #
    # ## Example
    # 
    #     module Ronin
    #       module Exploits
