      # Methods for building Stack Overflow buffers.
      #
      # ## Example
      #
      #     include Mixins::StackOverflow
      #
      #     def build
      #       ebp = 0x06eb9090
      #       eip = 0x1001ae86
      #
      #       buffer = buffer_overflow(length: 1024, nops: 16, payload: payload, bp: ebp, ip: eip)
      #       # ...
      #     end
      #
      # If you want more control over how the buffer is constructed:
      #
      #     include Mixins::StackOverflow
      #
      #     def build
      #       ebp = 0x06eb9090
      #       eip = 0x1001ae86
      #
      #       buffer = junk(1024) + nops(16) + payload + stack_frame(ebp,eip)
      #       # ...
      #     end

        # Builds the stack overflow buffer containing the payload, nops, and a
        # stack frame.
        #
        # @param [Integer] length
        #   The desired total length of the buffer.
        #
        # @param [Integer, nil] nops
        #   The amount of NOP padding before the payload.
        #
        # @param [#to_s] payload
        #   The payload to add to the buffer.
        #
        # @param [Integer] bp
        #   The stack base pointer address.
        #
        # @param [Integer] ip
        #   The instruction pointer address.
        #
        # @return [String]
        #   The built buffer.
        #
        # @example
        #   ebp = 0x06eb9090 # short jump 6 bytes
        #   eip = 0x1001ae86 # pop pop ret 1001AE86 SSLEAY32.DLL
